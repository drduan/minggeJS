# minggeJS

Since the awesome screenshot plugin **shearkhoto**, I started a new copy of JQUERY which is made by Chinese. Why I started this? Frankly speaking, I had never use jQUERY before because I hate JQUERY badly. What is the reason of that? Because I am absolutely able to build such a damn library and fully realize the technical detail in jQUERY. But JQUERY is a giant of Front-End and has a huge number of believers, which inspired me and brought an idea â€” How about start an new one JQUERY that using my mind. After the idea came out, I started this project.

I gave it a fucking cool name: **MingGeJs**.

What is MingGeJs? It is a project took me a week to done and a JS library which has the same syntax, same methods and same usage with JQUERY. But MingGeJs is better than jQ in Animations, Selector and method performance. BTW, MingGeJs works with IE 6, 7 and 8 very well. Of course, you can use MingGeJs and jQUERY together.

Its name is MingGeJs while MingGe is my name. This library will remind you of me when you see its name and remind you of the fact that this library is made by **Chinese**. We have to show our skill to the world and let them know our project also good, even better than theirs.

I have not a Bachelor degree even never enter a high school. I have no any idea about English. But, it will not stop me on the road to succeed. MingGeJS has a huge and distant goal that means taking over half of users of JQUERY in the whole world. MingGeJs is an open source project that hosted in GIT, I welcome all of you to have a try!

I am MingGe. I initiative, let's give a support to Chinese-made minggeJS library as Chinese.
