# minggeJS

Since the awesome screenshot plugin **shearkhoto**, I started an new copy of JQUERY which is made by Chinese. Why I started this? Frankly speaking, I had never use jQUERY before because I hate JQUERY badly. What is the reason of that? Because I am absolutely able to build such a damn library and fully realize the technical detail in jQUERY. But JQUERY is a giant of Front-End and has a huge number of believers, which inspired me and brought an idea â€” How about start an new one JQUERY that using my mind. After the idea came out, I started this project.

I gave it a fucking cool name: **MingGeJs**.

What is MingGeJs? It is a project took me a week to done and a JS library which has the same syntax, same methods and same usage with JQUERY. But MingGeJs is better than jQ in Animations, Selector and method performance. BTW, MingGeJs works with IE 6, 7 and 8 very well. Of course, you can use MingGeJs and jQUERY together.

Its name is MingGeJs while MingGe is my name. This library will remind you of me when you see its name and remind you of the fact that this library is made by **Chinese**. We have to show our skill to the world and let them know our project also good, even better than theirs.

I have not a Bachelor degree even never enter a high school. I have no any idea about English. But, it will not stop me on the road to succeed. MingGeJS has a huge and distant goal that means taking over half of users of JQUERY in the whole world. MingGeJs is an open source project that hosted in GIT, I welcome all of you to have a try!

I am MingGe. I initiative, let's give a support to Chinese-made minggeJS library as Chineses.

## minggeJS Release v1.7

Thanks for the BUG reports submitted by GIT contributor. There were lots of BUG in version 1.6, since I was in a hurry. They've almost fixed now! minggeJS added some new APIs I haven't noted down, such as JSONP, attr(), and optimized some functions. I gratefully welcome the contributions to my GIT, so I'll be able to fix update the on time!

Version 1.6 released last time did not introduce any advantage of minggeJS, so lots of people were tugging on my campy and futureless copy of JQUERY. I said I'll take 50 percent market share of JQ. I've SAID that, I'll never withdraw. I don't even lose anything if I fail it. JQUERY won't be angry because of my challenge. Failure is not a matter to me at all! I'm copying angularjs as well. It's 20 percent finished and I'll make it open source then. I don't damn care how strong the competitor is! I will challenge them!

I'll describe several advantages of minggeJS here:

minggeJS has the following advantages 1: execution speed of selector surpasses JQUERY. I tested 100,000 nodes, with minggeJS and JQUERY selector respectively: JQUERY result: IE7 and newer 1800ms IE7 8135ms IE6 30-40s and browser freezes randomly. minggeJS result: IE7 newer: 1500ms IE7 5132ms IE6 23-35s, browser freezes as well but in a lower chance. Shorter the time costs, better the selector is. From the result, minggeJS gained a complete victory. I tested the browser developed by RubyLouvre, which claims to be the fastest in the world, as well. The result was too close to call! It is noteworthy that, I heard that JQUERY selector is not developed by the company originally, and it is modified third-party selector! I can say this with a clear conscience: the selector of minggeJS is developed TOTALLY by myself.

2: As everyone knows, JQUERY features timer in animation. minggeJS, which features CSS3 transition, is different. It is a pity that IE678 was not supported. minggeJS is not the first one who adopts CSS3 transition animation. zepto features this property as well. zepto, however, really sucked its job due to its nonsupport of serial transition. minggeJS supports serial animation, supports high efficiency callback, supports interfaces querying animation status. I would say minggeJS is the best choice for cellphone animation!

3: Syntax, function syntax, function names are kept the same as JQUERY. minggeJS is easy and handy, you'll know how to use it as long as you know how to use JQUERY. Some functions are a little different, e.g. create a new node in mingge can be achieved by $(XX).createNode(), which is more convenient than JQUERY! minggeJS is not a simple copy of JQUERY, it's more like a fusion of JQUERY and my own IDEA!

4: File has the size of around 20K. It may grow to 40K in later updates. My idea is that it will not exceed 40K.

5: The later development of minggeJS would concentrate in mobile platforms. Even if it can't beat JQUERY, it's still eyeable to beat zepto. Furthermore, I plan to provide two animation interfaces to developers, one is CSS3, the other one is CSS2 timer. The timer animation interface, might be released in the form of a plugin!
